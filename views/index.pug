  p My current reading list : books open at the moment.

  p This website is a very basic Express website developed as a tutorial example on the Mozilla Developer Network. This website builds on the #[em auth] branch of the Express Local Library Tutorial, which is and undocumented implementation of User Authentication and simple Role-Based Authorization.

  p The last commit in this branch is 17 months old, so there will be dependency updates to make. Doing a review of them and where possible doing manual fixes will be a good learning project.
